# HelloCodi

[HelloCodi](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/hello-codi.html) was your first creation in App Inventor. It involved three pieces: a button with an image, a text field, and a sound that played when the button was clicked.

Your task is to recreate HelloCodi for the web. There are three main components to any web app or webpage:

1. **HTML:** The skeleton of your code, where you define your content, but *not* how it looks or behaves. This is like dragging elements from the "Palette" in App Inventor.
2. **CSS:** The styles where you define the appearance of your elements, much like changing the properties in the App Inventor "Designer".
3. **JavaScript:** The behaviour of your code. This is like the "Blocks Editor" in App Inventor.

## Steps

1. Begin by downloading [`template.html`](/resources/template.html) (in `resources` on GitHub) to your working directory, and renaming it `HelloCodi.html`.

    - To download a file from GitHub, first click on its link, then **right-click on `Raw`** and "Save link as..."

2. Add a button to the body of the page, with an image (and no text) inside of it.

    - In these modules, you can always find a list of [resources](#resources) to help you with each step!
    - Your image should show Codi the bee (you can download the image from the [HelloCodi](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/hello-codi.html) App Inventor tutorial).

3. Add text below the button that says "Touch the Bee!".

    - Again, check the resources below for help.

4. Now the tricky part! Make the button play the bee sound when it is clicked.

    - Check the resources!
    - Any time you want your page to *do* something, you will need to use JavaScript.

5. Success! Check the [Assessment](#assessment) for ideas on how to further improve your code.
