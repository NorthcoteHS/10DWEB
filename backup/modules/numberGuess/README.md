# numberGuess

I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. Can you guess it?

Your job is to create a program that "thinks" of a number and lets the user guess!

## Steps

1. Create a new file and save it as `numberGuess.html`.

    - In the file, create the basic HTML structure, with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
    - Do **not** use a template file for this task - we want you to practise the HTML structure!

2. Create the HTML contents of the page. You should have:

    -

3. Create the HTML contents of the cheque, *ignoring* styling for now. You should have:



1. Always start by creating a new file in IDLE (Ctrl+n or Command+n).

    - Save the new file as `numberGuess.py` in your 10DPRO directory.

2. Pick a number - either by "hard-coding" (so it's the same each time) or by generating a random number.

  - See the resources if you want a random number!

3. Use `print` and `input` to display a welcome message and ask the user for their guess.

4. If they guess correctly, tell them so! If they're wrong, tell them if they're too high or too low.

  - Notice we said "if" - that means if statements! (See the resources...)

5. This program would be best if it kept looping until the user guesses correctly, or gives them a certain number of guesses.

  - See the "loops" resources if you want to loop!

5. Try challenging yourself by completing the silver, gold, and diamond expectations!

## Assessment

| Level  | Expectations |
|--------|--------------|
| Bronze | Hard-coded number, lets the user guess once |
| Silver | Random number |
| Gold   | Lets the user guess repeatedly |
| Diamond | Has a score (based on # of guesses), lets the user reset with a new number, choose different difficulties, or any other creative ideas! |

- **Note:** all code should be commented and you should have no redundant code
