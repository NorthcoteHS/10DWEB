# helloWorld

["Hello, World!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) is the first program of almost every programmer. It is one of the most basic programs you can write, and simply displays the text "Hello, World!" to a screen (or other output).

Your goal is to write the HTML necessary to display "Hello, World!" to the user in a web page.

## Steps

1. Before starting this module, your teacher will ask you to complete some online learning tasks (e.g. Khan Academy or Codecademy).

2. Start this module by opening Brackets, making a new file (Ctrl-N), and saving it (Ctrl-S) as `helloWorld.html`.

    - Brackets will automatically colour and style your code, but only **after** you have saved the file with an appropriate extension (`.html`).

3. Every document has a basic HTML structure, sometimes called the "skeleton". You can find an example [here](http://htmlshell.com/) (note, the `meta` and `title` are not necessary, but are good practice). Fill out the basic HTML structure for your webpage.

    - Remember, every HTML page must start with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and have an `<html>` section with the a `<head>` and `<body>`.
    - Also remember that each HTML element (like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`) needs a matching close tag when it ends! (`</html>`, etc)

4. Once you have the HTML structure filled out, put an `<h1>` element in the body with the message, "Hello, world!"

Congratulations, you're done your first HTML program!
