# helloHtml

Now that you've made your first HTML page, it's time to learn more about HTML.

HTML is not a programming language - it is a "markup" language (HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language").
It is a way of formatting and presenting information.
It allows you to create objects ("elements") on a webpage - you can think of each element as a **container** that you can put other elements into (and in turn those elements can contain other elements, and so on).

The most basic HTML element is called a `<div>`.
This is an empty container, which you can put any other objects inside.
This "groups" those objects so you can move them around on the page, apply a set of styles to them, and more.
There are also a number of text elements, like `<h1>` (Header 1) and `<p>` (Paragraph) that will style text in different ways (`<h1>` makes the text large and bold).

Take a look at the [htmlGuide.html](/resources/htmlGuide.html) available in this course's resources page, and see it in action [here](https://northcotehs.github.io/10DWEB/resources/htmlGuide.html).
Use this (and other resources at the bottom of this page) as a reference for this assignment.

## Steps

1. Before attempting this task, you should first complete [helloWorld](../1_helloWorld/).

2. Create a new file and save it as `helloHtml.html`.

    - In the file, create the basic HTML structure, with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
    - Do **not** use a template file for this task - we want you to practise the HTML structure!

3. Your task is to create *any* webpage you like, making sure you use at least one of each of these elements:

    - `<h1>`
    - `<p>`
    - `<a>` with an appropriate `href`
    - `<button>` (it doesn't have to "do" anything when clicked)
    - `<ul>` or `<ol>`, with `<li>` elements inside
    - `<select>`, with `<option>` elements inside
    - `<table>`, with `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements inside
    - group any elements that belong together by putting them into a `<div>`

4. The goal of this task is to learn the elements - your webpage doesn't have to make sense, and the elements don't need to be related to each other. But do make sure to put *some* text into every element that needs text!

Congratulations, you've now used many of the most common HTML elements!
